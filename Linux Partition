Linux partition:
Partitioning is a method which allow us to divide a hard drive into isolated sections where each section behaves as its own hard drive.
Partitioning is particularly useful if we run multiple operating systems.
There are lots of powerful tools for creating, removing, and otherwise manipulating disk partitions in Linux.

Steps to create a partition:
1.List partitions.
2.Label a partition.
3.Use mkpart to make a partition.
4.Let the partition be created/settle.
5.Attach the file system to the partition.
6.Create a Mount point directory.
7.Add entry in fstab.
8.Systemctl daemon-reload.
9.Mount the partition on the directory.
10.Reboot.

Commands:
1.List block with UUID Lsblk: fs /dev/vdb
2.List partitions: parted -l
3.Make label to a partition: parted /dev/vdb mklabel msdos
4.Create a partition: mkpart
5.Wait till partition is registered successfully: udevadm settle
6.Format file system with XFS file system: mkfs.xfs /dev/vdb1
7.Restart daemon service: systemctl daemon-reload
