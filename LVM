LVM  in linux:
In Linux, Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a device mapper framework that provides logical volume management for the Linux kernel.
LVM is a tool for logical volume management which includes allocating disks, striping, mirroring and resizing logical volumes.
It is used for creating single logical volumes of multiple physical volumes for entire hard disk allowing for dynamic volume resizing.
Most modern Linux distributions are LVM aware to point of being able to have their root file system on a logical volume.
The main advantages of LVM are increased abstraction, flexibility, and control.

Each piece of a logical volume is important to manage them and that pieces are given below:
PV: Physical Volume sda
PP: Physical Partition sda1 , sda2
VG: Volume Group Pooled physical resources
LV: Logical Volume Seen as a storage facility to the operating system.

Basic commands of LVM :-

1) pvcreate: to create a physical volume.
2) pvdisplay: to display the physical volume. 
3) lvcreate -n name -L[size] name: to create a logical volume.
4) lvdisplay: to display the logical volume. 
5) vgcreate vgname[pv]: to create a volume group. 
6) vgdisplay: to display the volume group.
